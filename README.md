If there is no Makefile, a default Makefile will be created
_The default Makefile may need some change but makemake try to guess the default config_

### Usage

Create a new Makefile if any
and **update** the `.depend` file (or create it)

### Get it

`brew install Julow/tap/makemake`;

Without brew: Download `makemake.py` and do whatever you want
